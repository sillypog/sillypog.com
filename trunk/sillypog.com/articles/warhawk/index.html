 	<h1>Playstation's Warhawk Leaderboard widget</h1>
    <p>One of my first (semi)-professional Flash projects was the development of a leaderboard widget for Sony Playstation's Warhawk game. This is one of the few projects where I was entirely responsible for the concepting, design and development.</p>
    <p>A friend of mine was consulting for Sony as they developed their system for gathering player data and he offered me the opportunity to create the widget using their feed. The initial specifications were very general: we wanted to target as many social media sites as possible and it had to run on the Playstation 3, which meant developing for Flash Player 6 using Actionscript 2.</p>
	<p>One decision that was made before I was brought in was to use Clearspring to manage social media distribution.</p>
