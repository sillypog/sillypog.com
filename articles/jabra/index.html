    <h3>Launch application</h3>
    <p>This iPad slot machine app was created to bring tradeshow attendees into the Jabra booth at a Las Vegas tradeshow. I was responsible for all development on the application, including programming, asset production, sound design and final delivery. The application proved to be hugely popular at the show and I have since modified it for subsequent shows.</p>

    <span class="quoteMark">&#8220;</span><p>When lined up next to dozens of other like service and product providers, a real challenge at trade shows is having your booth stand out amongst the rest. Since the show happened to be in Las Vegas, we decided to play to our environment – dinging bells, cheering crowds and prizes. We projected our "slot machine" app on a giant plasma screen in the booth, turned up the volume, and the leads started rolling in. For a scan of the badge, an attendee got one "spin" on the machine. With nearly 100 prizes (including iPads, iPod shuffles, and CASH), our booth was constantly filled with hopeful "spinners" and we pulled in nearly half of the available leads at the entire show.<p>
	<p>But the success didn’t stop at the leads. Over the 3 day show, attendees and other booth vendors continually came to Jabra's booth and asked for pictures of the set up. "Who did that app?" "Who designed your booth?" "We would love something like that! How do we get one?". To each question, our client responded: We we work with the most amazing and innovative agency called the Loomis Group! This was all their idea!</p>

    <p>Given the short amount of development time, I chose to create the application in Flash and publish with Air for iOS. As we were delivering a single iPad installation to the client,
