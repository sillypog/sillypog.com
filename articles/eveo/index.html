    <p>While working as lead Flash developer at healthcare marketing firm Eveo, I was a key member of the team relaunching the company website. For the landing page, I created a unique interactive component for displaying our portfolio of work. The tile-flipping component was a great way to showcase the quality of design and engineering that goes into our products. The website won several awards that year, inluding XXX's best-in-class for Healthcare and a Top 10 site overall.</p>

        </ul>

    <p>The tiles initially display a mission statement while the preloader brings in the large images used to show the work. Once loaded, the tiles flip once in an animated wave from one corner, teasing the viewer with the images beneath and encouraging them to interact with the piece. Hovering over one tile reveals the image beneath (as well as setting its neighbors briefly in motion); clicking on it causes all of the tiles to flip to reveal the full image and the descriptive copy within it.</p>
    <p>I decided not to use a 3D engine for this work as I wanted to have very precise control over the lighting effects on the tiles as they move. Instead, the tiles subclass Soulwire's <a href="http://blog.soulwire.co.uk/code/open-source/two-sided-planes-in-flash-player-10">PaperSprite</a> class, which uses the built in 2.5D functionality introduced in Flash Player 10 to create a 2-sided sprite.</p>
